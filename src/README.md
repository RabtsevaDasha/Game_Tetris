# Tetris

The purpose of this work is to develop the game "Tetris". It refers to logic games that help develop reaction, train logic.

The meaning of the game is the desire to tightly occupy the playing field with falling geometric shapes, changing their
orientation in space, achieving the absence of spaces in each line.
Tetris is a game with little amount of basic physics principles that you should implement.
You have to form a full line with the "tetrominos" that are "falling".
These things, originally called "tetrominos", have 7 different shapes, from each there can be formed other 3 more shapes (by rotation).
I use a 3x3 matrix to represent each "tetromino" and notate with 1 where i want to form a block.
I have written code in Java.

#How to Play:

*Use arrow keys

*UP: rotate piece CW

*DOWN: speeds up the piece

*LEFT/RIGHT: move piece left and right

*Score points by completing a row on gameboard
